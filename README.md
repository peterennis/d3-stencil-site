# Welcome to [D3-Stencil-Site](https://d3-stencil.dev)

I decided to split the docs and the project in two repositories. The main aim for that is to keep the commit history, issues board, etc. as clean as possible for both projects.

This repository is based on [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/). In case you are not used to it, please check the [docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-preparation).

If you are interested in adding something to this repository, I just can say... huge thanks! ![happy](https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/twitter/180/face-with-party-horn-and-party-hat_1f973.png)
